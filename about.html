        <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
               Hi, I am Braydyn. I am a Junior in Computer Science at the University of Idaho.
                Thoughout various years of learning computer science i have found a special passion for
                video game development as well as software engineering.
            </p>
        <p>
            I have working experience with C, C++, C#, Python, and Java. I specialize in developing
            software ranging from Low Level Calculators to High Level Game Design. My focus area is Game Development & Software Engineering.
            Ive developed various projects including Simulation Games, Platformer, and 3d Games, ive also created a linux command line
            simulator that processes commands similar to a linux system.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of coding, I’ve have had the chance to take leadership roles on campus,
            where I have developed skills in teamwork, management, and mentoring peers.
            As the President of Game Devs United, I’ve helped other students start working on their video game ideas ,
             I’ve also worked on collaborative development projects.
            Additionally, my experience in the Idaho Army National Guard has strengthened my discipline, adaptability, and teamwork.
        </p>
        <p>Beyond that i enjoy playing instruments such as the violin and guitar. I also enjoy working on creative projects such as woodworking
        Camping etc. This sort of thing helps me develop different environments in games.</p>
